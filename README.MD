# The Gym
Do you feel like you need to join a gym? Well here at Gym you can sign up and choose from three different tiers of memberships. With the ability to login at a later date and check on your membership status and see what's new!

## Our Mission
We set out to create an application that a gym can use to create and house their members information. This app has the ability to create and have members earn different tiers of memberships. They are also allowed to log back in and veiw previous memberships as well.

## Application Requiremnts:
You and your group will use everything you’ve learned over the past six weeks to create a real-world full-stack application that you’ll be able to showcase to potential employers. The user story and acceptance criteria will depend on the project that you create, but your project must fulfil the following requirements:

* Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.
* Use Handlebars.js as the templating engine.
* Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.
* Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.
* Be deployed using Heroku (with data).
* Use at least one new library, package, or technology that we haven’t discussed.
* Have a polished UI.
* Be responsive.
* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
* Have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm.
* Include authentication (express-session and cookies).
* Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.
* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
* Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

Finally, you must add your project to the portfolio that you created in Module 2.

### Challenges:
Challenges that arose: The handle bars was the most stressful part of this project. But it was nice to work through them and learn from our mistakes when first starting. (shoutout to Steven TA for the help).
 
### Successes:
We got our interactive website to work functionally for the most part and got to master the handlebars in the last class.
